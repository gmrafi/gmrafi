## About Me
I am Rafi, an undergraduate, passionate writer, and hobbyist web designer.

In addition to my love for writing, I’ve also delved into the world of web design and development, particularly focusing on WordPress. While I may not be a professional web designer, it’s become my favorite leisure activity, allowing me to unleash my creativity and build digital spaces.
